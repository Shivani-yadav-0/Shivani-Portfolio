**Senior Research Associate | BluePath Solutions**

As a Health Economics professional, I led the development of advanced HEOR models to support market access and pricing strategy for innovative oncology therapies. I designed and built a comprehensive U.S. payer cost calculator incorporating current Medicare and commercial reimbursement methodologies, and developed cost-effectiveness and budget impact models for an investigational allogeneic T-cell immunotherapy across multiple hematologic malignancies. Leveraging R for cure-mixture survival modeling, I estimated long-term cure fractions to inform value demonstration. I spearheaded client-facing engagements to present modeling results and communicate healthcare economic information (HCEI), driving cross-functional alignment across medical, legal, and regulatory stakeholders.

**Senior Health Economist	| Skyward Analytics**
 
As a Senior Health Economist at Skyward Analytics (Apr 2022 – Jun 2024), I led impactful health economics projects, including developing cost-effectiveness and budget impact models for cancer therapies. I utilized tools like Python, SQL, and Excel to streamline clinical data analysis, automate processes, and enhance model efficiency. By introducing quality control SOPs and creating interactive Tableau dashboards, I reduced errors, improved team engagement, and expedited project timelines. My contributions significantly influenced strategic decision-making, strengthened client partnerships.

**Analyst | CHEORS**

As an Analyst, I developed tailored cost-effectiveness and budget impact models for various countries, improving accuracy and policy relevance. I implemented a Markov model for CRBSI, increasing analysis efficiency and supporting better healthcare decision-making. My exceptional project delivery earned recognition and an award for producing superior-quality cost-effectiveness reports.
